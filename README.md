# carbon-calc

This is carbon-calc, a user friendly, interactive web-page built on Python using Streamlit, a framework. 

It works by calculating user input, which includes key points such as Vehicular Emissions, Dietary Consumptions, Power consumption and Waste Generated on a daily, weekly or monthly basis.

Users can add their values using a slider, making it interactive and easy to use.

Okay bye!
